# Film Library

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, i have designed and developed this fictional Film Library. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my coding and design skills by
integrating the knowledge gained throughout the first semester. The Film Library includes a discover page to discover films, a feature to save films, and a feature to search, filter and search through all the films in the library.

## Usage

To use the Film Library, open the Netlify link (below), scroll through the film carousels on the discover page, or sort. filter, and search through all the films in the library. To save a film, click on the film card, and click the save button in the modal. The modal also includes details about the film, such as description, release year, country, and the average rating.

## Features

Discover films through the discover page.
Save films in the Saved page.
Saved films are saved in the browsers local storage.
Search, sort, and filter through all the films in the library.
Simple, responsive user interface.
